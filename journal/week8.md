# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

## Overview

This week we will be using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) to create a serverless image processing pipeline. We will be using the [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) service to run our code, and [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store our images. We will also be using the [AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service to perform image analysis.

## Pre-requisites
- Amazon CDK installed and configured

### Implement CDK Stack

- For this, we will follow week 8 - Serverless Image Processing and copy all the files from the thumbing-serverless-cdk folder into our project. We will also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
      npm install aws-cdk -g
      cd thumbing-serverless-cdk
      cp .env.example .env
      npm i
```
> Note: To create a new CDK project, you can use the following command:
```bash
cdk init app --language=typescript
```
You can integrate this in your gitpod.yml file as well.
- It is necessary to change the `.env` file based on the `env.example` to use your own s3 bucket name and URL
- Synthesize the CDK stack:
```bash
      cdk synth
```
- Bootstrap the CDK stack and make sure you are using the correct AWS account and region:
```bash
      cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_REGION"
```
> **Note:** Make sure to use a version of Node.js that is supported by AWS Lambda. At the time of writing, the latest version of Node.js supported by AWS Lambda is 18.0, you can install it with nvm:
```bash
# install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# install node 18
nvm install 18.0.0
```
- After doing so, you should be able to see the bucket created, make sure you are located in the right region using the AWS console

- Deploy the CDK stack:
```bash
cdk deploy
```
- You should be able to see the following output:
![cdk-output](../_docs/assets/cdk-output.png)
- Confirm that you want to deploy the stack by typing `y` and pressing enter
- If the deployment was successful, you should be able to see the following output:
![cdk-deployed](../_docs/assets/cdk-deployed.png)
