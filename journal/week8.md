# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

## Overview

This week we will be using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) to create a serverless image processing pipeline. We will be using the [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) service to run our code, and [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store our images. We will also be using the [AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service to perform image analysis.

## Pre-requisites
- Amazon CDK installed and configured

### Implement CDK Stack

- For this, we will follow week 8 - Serverless Image Processing and copy all the files from the thumbing-serverless-cdk folder into our project. We will also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
      npm install aws-cdk -g
      cd thumbing-avatar-cdk
      cp .env.example .env
      npm i
```
> Note: To create a new CDK project, you can use the following command:
```bash
cdk init app --language=typescript
```
You can integrate this in your gitpod.yml file as well.
- It is necessary to change the `.env` file based on the `env.example` to use your own s3 bucket name and URL
- Synthesize the CDK stack:
```bash
      cdk synth
```
- Bootstrap the CDK stack and make sure you are using the correct AWS account and region:
```bash
      cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_REGION"
```
> **Note:** Make sure to use a version of Node.js that is supported by AWS Lambda. At the time of writing, the latest version of Node.js supported by AWS Lambda is 18.0, you can install it with nvm:
```bash
# install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# install node 18
nvm install 18.0.0
```
- After doing so, you should be able to see the bucket created, make sure you are located in the right region using the AWS console
![cdk-bucket](../_docs/assets/cdk-bucket.png)
- Deploy the CDK stack:
```bash
cdk deploy
```
- You should be able to see the following output:
![cdk-output](../_docs/assets/cdk-output.png)
- Confirm that you want to deploy the stack by typing `y` and pressing enter
- If the deployment was successful, you should be able to see the following output:
![cdk-deployed](../_docs/assets/cdk-deployed.png)
- Install the process-image dependencies:
```bash
cd process-image
npm i
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3
```
- Install the node_modules for aws lambda:
```bash
npm install
rm -rf node_modules/sharp
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --arch=x64 --platform=linux --target=12.13.0 sharp
```
- Make sure that your bucket is already created in s3, if not, create it manually
- Deploy the process-image stack:
```bash
cdk deploy
```
- In your assets bucket, create a folder `original` and `processed`
- upload an image to the `original` folder called `data.jpg`
- setup and env called DOMAIN_NAME in your environment variables

### Serve Avatars via CloudFront
- In your AWS console, go to CloudFront and create a new distribution
```
Origin Domain Name: <your-bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com
Name: <your-bucket-name>
Origin Access: Origin Access control setting
```
> **Note:** You must create a control setting to continue
```
Default Cache Behavior Settings: Use legacy cache settings
Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
Origin Request Policy: CORS-CustomOrigin
Response Headers Policy: Simple CORS
```
- Create an ACM certificate in the us-east-1 region and validate it
```
Custom SSL Certificate: <your-certificate>
Add a description: <your-certificate>
```
- You might need to wait a few minutes for the distribution to be deployed
- Create a new record set in Route53
```
Name: assets.<your-domain-name>
Type: A - IPv4 address'
Route traffic to: Alias to CloudFront distribution
```
- Make sure that `data.jpg` is uploaded to the `original` folder in your bucket
- Add the following policy to your bucket:
```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::assets.waltergaitan.me/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                  "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::596027898727:distribution/ERP1HKKVALIMN"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
- Change the `DOMAIN_NAME` in your `.env` file to the domain name of your CloudFront distribution
- Modify your `thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts` file to use your CloudFront distribution
- Modify `serverless` folder to be `avatar` instead and modify the scripts as well
- Upload file using script to test if it works
```bash
./bin/avatar/upload
```
