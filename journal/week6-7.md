## Tasks

### Watch ECS Security by Ashish
In this video, I learned about the following:
- ECS Security
- Best practices
- Create a new ECS cluster
- Push image using the CLI
- How to inspect repository using Snyk or AWS Inspector

### Watch Fargate Technical Questions with Maish (Not yet uploaded)

### Provision ECS Cluster
In this task, the following was done:
- Create a new ECS cluster named `cruddur`
- Create a new task definition 
- Create a new service using the CLI
```shell
aws ecs create-cluster \
--cluster-name cruddur \
--service-connect-defaults namespace=cruddur
```

### Create ECR repo and push image for backend-flask

- Create a new ECR repository named `backend-flask`
- Create a new ECR repository named `cruddur`
- Login to ECR using the CLI
- Push the `python:3.10-slim` image to the `cruddur` repository
- Create a new image named `backend-flask` using the `Dockerfile` in the `backend-flask` directory
- Push the `backend-flask` image to the `backend-flask` repository

### Deploy Backend Flask app as a service to Fargate
There are some prerequisites for this task:
-  Create a parameter with the following command
```shell
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" --value $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" --value $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/CONNECTION_URL" --value $PROD_CONNECTION_URL
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" --value $ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS" --value "x-honeycomb-team=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"
```
- Create a `service-execution-policy.json` file in the `policies` directory 
- Run the following command to create the policy
```shell
 aws iam create-role \
    --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole \
    --assume-role-policy-document  file://aws/policies/service-execution-policy.json
```
